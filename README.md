# adventuregui

This is an early test of trying to get the "tensodoct.js" code working in a web gui. 

To test this locally, use python to set up a web server in the local directory by using `python -m http.server` or `python3 -m http.server` (whichever works best), and navigating to `http://localhost:8000/?gameFile=adv01.dat` in a web browser.
